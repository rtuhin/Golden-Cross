# Golden Cross & Death Cross
This python snippet can be used to test trading strategies using the golden cross and the death cross. In the current version, the code can be run to test a strategy to go long when the 50-day moving average breaks above and stays above the 200-day moving by at least 15 points, go short when the  50-day moving average falls and stays below the 200-day moving average by at least 15 points, and hold the cash value on all other days. Interest on cash and transaction costs are ignored.
